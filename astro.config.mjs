// This is the configuration file for your Astro project.
// It sets the site URL and defines a redirect from the root path to the English version of the site.
// Make sure to replace 'https://infusion-site.vercel.app' with your actual live URL.
// The redirect ensures that anyone visiting the root of your site will be sent to the English
// version of your site, which is useful for SEO and user experience.
// You can add more redirects or modify the site URL as needed.
